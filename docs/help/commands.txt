Here's a list of the commands that work. To use them, just say "**@RevoBot**" and the command you want.

If you want to learn more about a command, say "**help** <*[command]*>".

Some tips:
~ **<>** = This is mandatory. The command won't work as expected without it!
~ **[]** = This is optional.
~ **|** = Use only one option!
~ **""** = Quotation marks are required! Otherwise, it won't work!
